#
# This file will need editing based on what config you want to generate from the json/yaml data.
#
# Provide the config lines for the features/functionalities you want to generate config for.
# These config lines are in the target system CLI syntax, but yank back to the encoded data structure to fetch arguments and iterations.
# These arguments are embedded as $variables, using a hash/array syntax to exactly point to the data in the encoded structure.
# The encoded data structure is either the json or yaml output produced by the 'extract' encoder.
# All of the following are valid variables pointing to values inside the data structure:
#
# $system{name}
# $vlan{x}
# $vlan{x}{name}
# $dns{server}[x]
# $ip{route}[x]{next-hop}
# $x				# 1-based array index of any of above variables containing [x] 
#
# Where 'x' is placed inside curlies, {x}, the commands will be repeated as many times as there are instances of data for x as hash key.
# Where 'x' is placed inside squares, [x], the commands will be repeated as many times as there are instances of data for x as array index.
#
# Note that a variable like $item{x}, where '{x}' is at the end of the variable, will result in keys of x being used. Which is the most intuitive
# if we expect the values to be lower level hashes. For example $vlan{x} will be the vlan-id key and all the data for each vlan will be placed in
# lower level hash keys like $vlan{x}{name}, etc..
# If however the hash is flat, and the desired values are in the same hash, we can access those using $item{x:v}.
#
#
# Example1:
# vlan create $vlan{x} [name $vlan{x}{name}] type port-mstprstp $vlan{x}{instance}
#
# If we have this data in the encoded structure:
#   "vlan" : {
#      "1" : {
#         "ports" : "1/1-8"
#      },
#      "2" : {
#         "instance" : 0,
#         "name" : "Grt-2",
#         "ports" : "1/9",
#         "pvid" : "1/9",
#         "type" : "port",
#         "voice-vlan" : false
#      },
#      "5" : {
#         "instance" : 0,
#         "type" : "port",
#         "voice-vlan" : true
#      }
#   }
#
# Then the example1 line will produce this config output:
# vlan create 2 name GRT-2 type port-mstprstp 0
# vlan create 5  type port-mstprstp 0
#
# If the $variable includes an "x" index, then that index is allowed to iterate across all relevant values in the data structure.
# Each command line can include optional sections. In the example above [name $vlan{x}{name}] is an optional section and is only
# included in the output if there is a value for that variable in the data structure for the x iteration.
# Whereas if there is no value for a $variable which is not part of an optional section, then the whole line is omitted; for example
# we got no vlan creation command line for vlan 1, as there was no value for $vlan{x}{instance} with x = 1
#
#
# Example2:
# vlan create $vlan{x} [name $vlan{x}{name}] type port-mstprstp 0	&IF: $vlan{x} > 1
#
# In this case we might not care about mapping ERS STP instances over to the VOSS config, so we hard code the instance to 0.
# But now we don't want to generate a config with a vlan 1 creation command. So we can apply constraints to commands to add to our
# generated config file by appnding &IF: <condition-to-eval>.
# The <condition-to-eval> is evaluated and only if the result is true then the line is added to the produced config.
#
#
# Example3:
# i-sid $vlan{x}{isid} elan
#    c-vid $vlan{x} ports $vlan{x}{ports}
# exit
#
# Indentation can be used to make inner context lines, dependant on the outer context.
# If we have this data in the encoded structure:
#   "vlan" : {
#      "1" : {
#         "ports" : "1/1-8"
#      },
#      "2" : {
#         "instance" : 0,
#         "name" : "Grt-2",
#         "ports" : "1/9",
#         "pvid" : "1/9",
#         "type" : "port",
#         "voice-vlan" : false
#      },
#      "210" : {
#         "i-sid" : 2800210,
#         "instance" : 0,
#         "name" : "Green-210",
#         "ports" : "1/10-11",
#         "pvid" : "1/10-11",
#         "type" : "port",
#      },
#      "211" : {
#         "i-sid" : 2800211
#      },
#   }
#
# Then the example3 line will produce this config output:
# i-sid 2800210 elan
#    c-vid 210 ports 1/10-11
# exit
# i-sid 2800211 elan
# exit
#
# Note that for the 2nd line (c-vid ...) does not appear for vlans 1 & 2, as these have no i-sid and hence did not create the 1st line either.
# Also note not for vlan 211 as there are no ports.
#
#
# Example4:
# radius server host $radius{server}{ip} [acct-enable &IF: $radius{server}{accounting}] [timeout $radius{server}{timeout}]
#
# Here the optional acct-enable parameter is included based on the &IF: evaluation of $radius{server}{accounting}
#
# With this data:
#   "radius" : {
#      "server" : {
#         "accounting" : true,
#         "ip" : "10.8.255.17",
#         "timeout" : 4
#      }
#
# Produces this line:
# radius server host 10.8.255.17 acct-enable timeout 4
#
#
# Example5:
# vlan ports $port{x} tagging $port{x}{tagging} [filter-untagged-frame $port{x}{filter-untagged-frame}%:enable,disable]
#
# Appending '%:<value1>,<value2>' to a vaiable will result in value1 being replaced if the variable is true and value2 otherwise
