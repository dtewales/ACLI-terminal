# These steps install the necessary modules and dependencies for running ACLI terminal on the XMC underlying Ubuntu.
# but only for the text based: acli, acmd, aftp, cfm-test, spb-ect, termtest
# There is no point installing dependencies for acligui and xmcacli since these require a GUI which is not available on XMC's underlying ubuntu

# NOTE: the steps below are modifying the XMC OS. Be aware that if you have problems with XMC and you report these to GTAC,
# GTAC might request that you prove that the issue you are reporting also happens without these modifications.
# ==> I.e. you might have to re-install XMC to satisfy that request

# Initialize apt cache
apt update
# This seems required, else first apt install below will ask for it

# Install required Perl modules available via apt
apt install libnet-telnet-perl
apt install libnet-ssh2-perl

# Install required Perl modules not available via apt
cpan install Net::Ping::External
cpan install Control::CLI
