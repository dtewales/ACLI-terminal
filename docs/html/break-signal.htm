<h1>Sending Break signal</h1>
<p>The break signal is outside the ASCII character set but has local meaning on some end systems (for example on some Cisco systems it is necessary to stop the boot sequence). The intention is to indicate that the Break Key or the Attention Key (on older terminals) was hit. The break signal is well defined over serial port RS232 communication and Telnet. It is less well defined over SSH. The ACLI terminal relies on the break signal implementation offered by the underlying <i>Control::CLI</i> module, which implements the break signal over serial RS232 using a 300ms pulse_break and over Telnet using the appropriate telnet option. Over SSH, the <i>Control::CLI</i> class currently simply sends <i>'~B'</i> in the data stream, though it is not clear if any SSH implementation supports this.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to send the break signal. You can use either the <i>'@send break'</i> embedded command or the <i>'send break'</i> command under the ACLI control interface.</p>
<pre>
	VSP-8284XSQ:1#% @send brk
	VSP-8284XSQ:1#%
</pre>
<pre>
	ACLI> send brk
	ACLI>
</pre>
<p>However, the break signal typically needs to be sent while the connected device is booting up, at a very precise moment, so issuing an ACLI embedded command will not be possible and entering into the ACLI control interface may take too much time. for this reason the ACLI terminal pre-allocates a CTRL key to generate the break signal. By default the break signal control sequence is CTRL-S; this can however be changed in the <i>acli.ini</i> file. See the ACLI ini file section.</p>
<pre>
	ACLI> ctrl info
	CTRL characters:
	        Escape character     : ^]
	        Quit character       : ^Q
	        Terminal mode toggle : ^T
	        More paging toggle   : ^P
	        Send Break           : ^S
	        Debug                : ^[
