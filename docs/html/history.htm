<h1>Command History</h1>

<p>The ACLI terminal, in interactive mode, operates in a command oriented fashion. In this mode the actual command sent to the connected device can be different from the command that the user actually typed in. For example the command might include a grep string (which is removed and not sent to the device), or a variable (which is de-referenced before sending), or an alias.</p>
<p>ACLI actually maintains four separate CLI histories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A user-entered command history; this is a history of all commands actually entered by the user. This history can be viewed with the following command:
	<pre>@history user-entered</pre>
	<pre>ACLI> history user-entered</pre>
	</li>
	<li>A device-sent command history; this is a history of all commands as sent to the connected device. This history matches the history maintained by the connected device, if supported. This history can be viewed with the following command:
	<pre>@history device-sent</pre>
	<pre>ACLI> history device-sent</pre>
	</li>
	<li>A no-error-device command history; this is a history of all commands as sent to the connected device which did not generate an error from the device. This history variant is useful when using the ACLI dictionary functionality. This history can be viewed with the following command:
	<pre>@history no-error-device</pre>
	<pre>ACLI> history no-error-device</pre>
	</li>
	<li>A recall command history; a distilled list of user-entered command history, where no command is duplicate and the order is always rearranged to give the most recent command first. These commands can be recalled simply using the cursor keys or via <i>!&lt;n&gt;</i>. This history can be viewed with the following command:
	<pre>@history</pre>
	<pre>ACLI> history recall</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above histories can be inspected or cleared using the <i>@history</i> embedded command (in interactive mode) or the <i>'history'</i> command under the ACLI> control interface.</p>
<pre>
	@history [clear|device-sent|echo|info|no-error-device|user-entered]
</pre>
<pre>
	ACLI> history clear|device-sent|echo|info|no-error-device|recall|user-entered
</pre>
<p>ACLI does not limit the size of these histories (unlike the devices which typically limit their history size to some maximum number of commands).</p>
<p>Another nice property of ACLI history is that, since these are held by the terminal itself, they are preserved across device reconnection, or device reboot</p>

<p>The example above uses double bang '!!' to recall the last command entered. The example below inspects the recall history and then a command is recalled by index.</p>

<p>Notice that when a history recall is made, ACLI will add an echo line immediately after indicating the full command that was recalled. History echoing is by default enabled but can be disabled using the <i>'@history echo'</i> embedded command or the <i>'history echo'</i> command under ACLI control interface.</p>
