<h1>Localized More Paging</h1>

<p>When a device generates CLI output over many lines, usually the output is paged with <i>--more--</i> prompts. These allow the user to hit Space to view subsequent pages.</p>
<p>The ACLI terminal, in interactive mode, will also page output using more paging, but the paging is localized on the terminal and not on the connected device. What this means is that once a command has been sent to the connected device, any output produced is collected in its entirety by ACLI, but is then paged locally by ACLI on the terminal window.</p>
<p>This provides for a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provides a consistent output paging approach, across all supported Extreme Networks devices</li>
	<li>Output can be paged (by hitting Space), scrolled one line at a time (by hitting Return) and disabled on the fly (by hitting CTRL-P)</li>
	<li>Some ACLI features (like grep) will result in not all device produced output being displayed; consequently if the remaining output still needs to be paged, then only localized more paging can do the job properly</li>
	<li>When the user pages through the output, the output is displayed much faster; this is because if the user pauses between each page, in the meantime ACLI will have already obtained and cached internally the whole (or subsequent) output and so the next page can be displayed very quickly. This is particularly noticeable when there is high latency on the connection or the command is slow to produce output.</li>
	<li>The connected device is not held midway a CLI command if the user does not complete (or quit) the more paging. In the case of VOSS, only one user at a time can execute "show running-config"; when multiple users are connected to the same VOSS device, it is not unusual for one user to page through the config, maybe slowly, which then prevents other users from also viewing the config. This cannot happen with ACLI, as the output of the "show running-config" is collected in one shot from the device (then locally paged to the user)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few ways in which the ACLI terminal collects all output from the device, in the background, without the user even realizing. On some Extreme Networks devices, which have a fast CPU, ACLI simply disables more paging on the device; on other older Extreme devices, or connections over the serial console port (which is typically slow @ 9600 baud), ACLI keeps more paging enabled on the device, and simply keeps feeding a space character in the background (without user knowing) to retrieve all pages of output. The distinction between devices with fast or slow responsiveness is made because the user might decide to simply quit the local more paging after the first or initial pages. On slow devices, if more paging is disabled, some long commands can take many seconds to complete. In this case it is preferable to keep paging enabled on the device, so that if the user decides to quit local more paging, then ACLI can do the same on the device's own output paging, and we obtain a more responsive interaction. On more recent/faster Extreme devices, typically the whole output can be obtained from the device (with more paging disabled) even before the user has time to hit space on the first page of local more paging. Should the user decide to quit local more paging, then any output cached from the devices is simply flushed. Which behaviour is used with which Extreme device is determined during the auto-detection before entering interactive mode.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>More paging ENABLED on device</b>: slow connection or device with slow CPU</li>
	<ul>
		<li>ACLI connection over serial port</li>
		<li>ACLI connection over Terminal Server</li>
		<li>ACLI Telnet/SSH connection to BaystackERS older models ERS4500, ERS2500, ES470, BPS-2000, Baystack450..</li>
		<li>ACLI Telnet/SSH connection to SecureRouter, WLAN2300, Accelar</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>More paging DISABLED on device</b>: fast connection + device with fast CPU</li>
	<ul>
		<li>ACLI Telnet/SSH connection to BaystackERS recent models ERS3500/3600/4800/4900/5900, VSP7024</li>
		<li>ACLI Telnet/SSH connection to PassportERS, VOSS, ExtremeXOS, ISW, WLAN9100</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>A further operation mode is sync mode; in sync mode the device more paging mode is kept in synch with the ACLI more paging mode. The ACLI more paging mode can be set or viewed via the embedded <i>@more</i> command, or via the <i>'more'</i> command under ACLI control interface, or can be toggled on/off using CTRL-P.</p>

<p>In sync mode, when user disables more paging on ACLI, then more paging is also disabled on the connected device; whereas if more paging is enabled on ACLI then it is also enabled on the connected device. Sync mode is useful when dumping really large tables (e.g. FDB or ARP cache in scaled environments, with thousands of entries, and it is desired to simply quit the output at the first page, simply to inspect the summary of the number of entries present.</p>
