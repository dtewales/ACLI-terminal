<h1>CLI augmented switches</h1>
<p>The ACLI terminal, in interactive mode, allows some standard switches to be added to regular CLI commands of the connected device. These are listed below:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>-y</b> : On CLI commands where the connected host will ask for a confirmation prompt (e.g. "Are you sure (Y/N) ?"), ACLI will automatically feed a 'Y' to the confirmation prompt. Note that in ACLI scripting mode this is done automatically and there is no need to add a <i>'-y'</i> switch to the commands. The exception is if the confirmation prompt contains either the 'reset' or 'reboot' keywords; in this case scripting mode will not automatically feed a 'Y', unless a <i>'-y'</i> was added to the command, or to the alias which triggered the script sequence.</li>
	<li><b>-n</b> : On CLI commands where the connected host will ask for a confirmation prompt (e.g. "Are you sure (Y/N) ?"), ACLI will automatically feed a 'N' to the confirmation prompt. Perhaps not very useful, but available for completeness!</li>
	<li><b>-e</b> : On CLI commands with ACLI redirect to file, adding the <i>'-e'</i> switch will ensure that the command output is also echo-ed to the terminal session (not just redirected to file).</li>
	<li><b>-s</b> : On CLI commands followed by an ACLI grep pattern, determines whether the grep patterns should be treated as case-sensitive.</li>
	<li><b>-i[n]</b> : Perform indentation and unwrapping of command output. In practice this switch is only applicable to certain switch commands:
	<ul>
		<li><b>show running-config</b> : on PassportERS/VOSS and BaystackERS devices which have a configuration file format which uses configuration contexts but which (unfortunately) do not provide any indentation. Applying the <i>'-i'</i> switch will thus add indentation to the configuration file. By default 3 space characters are used for indentation (or whatever has been set in <i>acli.ini</i>). Alternatively a number n can be provided with the <i>'-i[n]'</i> switch and then the indentation will be done using n space characters. In addition to that, on BaystackERS, the <i>'-i'</i> switch will also perform unwrapping of any config line (longer than 131 characters) which the ERS switch would otherwise wrap.</li>
		<li><b>show log file</b> & <b>show logging</b> : On BaystackERS and ISW devices the <i>'-i'</i> switch will perform unwrapping of long lines which the connected device has broken into two or more lines (which is not acceptable if we need to grep these lines with ACLI).</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><b>-b</b> : Remove comment/banner lines from show configuration output. This switch is essentially performing a simple negative grep on lines beginning with the character designating a comment line (';' on BaystackERS and '#' on most other devices). In practice this switch is only useful with switch commands which display the config file as it allows to obtain a compact config file which contains no comment/banner lines.</li>
	<li><b>-o[n]</b> : While socket tied and sourcing (ACLI scripting mode), send command to socket with optional [n] delay in seconds</li>
	<li><b>-f</b> : On commands feeding input data (&lt;CLI command&gt; -f // &lt;input1&gt; // &lt;input2&gt; ...) allows the input data to be cached for future invocation of the same command on same family type device. The cached input data is stored in file <i>acli.cache</i></li>
	<li><b>-h</b> : On commands feeding input data (&lt;CLI command&gt; -h // &lt;input1&gt; // &lt;input2&gt; ...) allows the input data to be cached for future invocation of the same command on same device. The cached input data is stored in file <i>acli.cache</i></li>
	<li><b>-peercpu</b> : On PassportERS/VOSS chassis based devices with dual CPs allows a CLI command entered on a session to the Master CP to be actually executed on the Standby CP alone (see the Peer CP functionality). Switch can also be abbreviated to <i>-peer</i></li>
	<li><b>-bothcpus</b> : On PassportERS/VOSS chassis based devices with dual CPs allows a CLI command entered on a session to the Master CP to be executed on both the Master CP and the Standby CP simultaneously (in practice the commands is executed on the Standby CP slightly before it is executed on the Master CP, so as to work to reset both CPs in a HA-mode config)(see the Peer CP functionality). Switch can also be abbreviated to <i>-both</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <i>'-i'</i> & <i>'-b'</i> switches are usually used together and are always appended to the "show running-config" CLI command which renders the config output in a format which is suitable for performing grep on if needed. To make things easy, the pre-defined ACLI alias <i>'cfg'</i> does just that:</p>
<pre>
	VSP-8284XSQ:1#% cfg
	         alias% show running-config -ib
	config terminal
	boot config flags sshd
	boot config flags telnetd
	password password-history 3
	ssh
	no web-server secure-only
	interface mgmtEthernet mgmt
	   auto-negotiate
	   ip address 192.168.56.71 255.255.255.0
	exit
	qos queue-profile 1 member add 1/1-1/42,2/1-2/42
	no ntp
	end
	
	VSP-8284XSQ:1#%
</pre>
