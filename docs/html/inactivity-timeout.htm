<h1>Keepalive Timer</h1>
<p>It is usually a security requirement to configure a CLI timeout on the devices, so that stale sessions will automatically close. Regrettably the ACLI author is not having any of that and the ACLI terminal, in interactive mode, implements a keepalive timer which will never let sessions timeout. The keepalive timer can be set or managed under the ACLI control interface using the "terminal" command; by default it is set to 4 minutes, which means that at every expiry the terminal will automatically send a carriage return to the connected host. These carriage returns are sent in the background and are not visible on the ACLI session. The CLI timeout on the host device thus can never expire and the connection can be kept running by ACLI indefinitely, or to be more precise until ACLI's own session timer expires.</p>
<p>If it is desired to disable this ACLI feature (and let the devices timeout themselves) it is sufficient to set the keepalive timer to 0 under the ACLI control interface.</p>
<pre>
	ACLI> terminal timers keepalive &lt;timer in minutes; 0 = disable&gt;
</pre>
<p>To always set the keepalive timer to zero (or to any other value) by default use the <i>acli.ini</i> file and set the <i>keepalive_timer_val</i> key. See the ACLI ini file section.</p>

<h1>Session Timeout</h1>
<p>If the ACLI keepalive timer is non null, then sessions will never time out. ACLI comes with a session timer which can be used to timeout connections but this is done on ACLI's terms, not the devices. The session timer can also be set or managed under the ACLI control interface using the <i>'terminal'</i> command.</p>
<pre>
	ACLI> terminal timers session &lt;timeout in minutes; 0 = disable&gt;
</pre>
<p>By default it is set to 10 hours and can also be set to a different default value using the <i>acli.ini</i> <i>session_timeout_val</i> key. Setting the ACLI session timer to 0 will disable it, which, if the keepalive timer is non null, will result in the ACLI session never expiring (perhaps not a good idea...)</p>
