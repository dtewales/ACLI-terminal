<h1>Suppression of unprintable login banners</h1>

<p>The Extreme Networks ERS (BaystackERS) platform CLI makes use of ANSI escape sequences to print the login spash banners. These banners are mostly a nuisance and if one is logging output to file, the resulting log file is just a big pile of gibberish.</p>
<p>The ACLI terminal reformats the ERS login banner into printable text only. Other ERS login pages, like confirmation of last login and login page are eliminated in favour of a login approach more similar to what is used with other devices.</p>
