<h1>ACLI Update</h1>
<p>The ACLI terminal and associated utilities covered in this section can be updated to the latest available versions by launching the ACLI update script.</p>
<p>To launch the update script simply use the shortcut under Start / ACLI / ACLI Update:</p>

<p>Or alternatively double click the <i>UPDATE.BAT</i> file in the ACLI install directory.</p>
<p>You should close all ACLI and ConsoleZ windows before launching the update script. This is not strictly necessary for all updates, but is mandatory if the update script has a newer version of the ConsoleZ executable. The update script will tell you if it cannot perform the update if a ConsoleZ window is still open.</p>
<p>Note, the update script will automatically restart with admin privileges if it detects that it does not have write access in the install directory</p>
<p>The install script will automatically connect to a few URLs. Some of these URLs are internal to Extreme corporate network, but at least one of the URLs will be available on the Internet. The script is menu driven inside a DOS box.</p>
<p>If your versions are up to date, the script will report the following:</p>

	ACLI Update script (v1.14)
	==========================
	
	Trying http://dante.extremenetworks.com/ACLI-terminal/updates
	Trying http://www.oranda.fr/ACLI-terminal/updates .
	
	All files are up to date!
	
	Select desired action:
	
	  (S) - Show full listing of all available update files and versions
	  (M) - Provide alternative URL where to pull updates
	  (Q) - Quit
</pre>
<p>If instead some newer versions are available, then the script will list the newer files available.</p>

<p>To perform the update, simply select the 'U' option. The script will then download the latest versions for the files which need to be updated and will replace those files in your ACLI install directory. The old files however are not deleted, but are placed in a rollback directory. You then simply need to restart ACLI / ConsoleZ and the new versions will be in place. An easy way to see the ACLI version and module versions is to run ACLI and execute the <i>version</i> command:</p>

<p>If for any reason you are not happy with the new versions (maybe a it introduces a new bug! Or it does not work properly), it is possible to roll back to the version you had before the update. To restore those versions simply run the ACLI update script again, and this time select the 'R' option to rollback.</p>

<p>Note that if a new major version of the ACLI distribution is out, it is possible that the update script will not be able to do the update normally. This is usually because the newer version uses a newer Perl version or adds new Perl modules. In this case the update script will still show the newer versions available but will not offer the 'U' update option. Instead it will offer to download the install zip file for the new ACLI distribution. The existing version will then need to be uninstalled and the new version installed in its place.</p>
