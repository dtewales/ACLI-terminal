<h1>ACLI Control Interface</h1>

<p>Much like Telnet & FTP, the ACLI terminal offers a control interface where new connections can be initiated (using the <i>'open'</i> command) and parameters for the terminal and connection can be viewed or managed. The ACLI Control interface is what you get when you launch the ACLI named tab, which produces a prompt: <i>"ACLI>"</i></p>
<pre>
	Loading alias file: C:\Users\lstevens\Scripts\acli\acli.alias
	Merging alias file: C:\Users\lstevens\.acli\merge.alias

	ACLI>
</pre>

<p>The control interface can also be obtained any time, even if already connected, simply by hitting CTRL-]. If in interactive mode, it can also be obtained by invoking the <i>@acli</i> embedded command</p>

</pre>

<p>If accessing the ACLI control interface while a connection exists, then to return to the connection session simply hit enter at the <i>ACLI></i> prompt</p>
<p>If running in interactive mode, most of the commands available under ACLI control interface are also available as embedded commands, so it is seldom necessary to access it.</p>
